With the following features:

* Sass compiled to css in an external stylesheet
* ES2015

* Install the packages with `npm install`!
* To start the dev server run `webpack-dev-server --progress --colors`
  * Your project is now live at 'localhost:8080' and livereloaded on change at 'localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server'
