# Collapsable Nav

With the following features:

* Responsive, simple navbar template
* Collapsable for mobile breakpoints
* Instructions in comments on how to modify
* Can modify structure by simply uncommenting code

### Why this?

Collapsable navbar templates such as Bootstrap exist but often include a lot of extra stuff that you have to remove if you just want something simpler. This is that something simpler. I wanted to build something extremely simple and easy to modify so that it can be used anything that just requires a simple navbar that collapses for a mobile screen.
