Alt-H1 Collapsable React Navbar
======

### Why this?

Collapsable navbar templates such as Bootstrap exist but often include a lot of extra stuff that you have to remove if you just want something simpler. This is that something simpler. I wanted to build something extremely simple and easy to modify so that it can be used anything that just requires a simple navbar that collapses for a mobile screen.

With the following features:

* Responsive, simple navbar template
* Collapsable for mobile breakpoints
* Instructions in comments on how to modify & customize
* Preset color variables

Built using:

* Webpack
* React, ReactDOM
* SASS
* A dab of jQuery
* Normalize CDN
* Font Awesome CDN for "hamburger" icon
